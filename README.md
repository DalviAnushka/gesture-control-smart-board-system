# Hand Gesture Controlled Virtual Board

## Introduction

The **Hand Gesture Controlled Virtual Board** is an interactive, touch-free digital smart board that enables users to draw, write, and solve problems using **hand gestures** instead of traditional input devices.
Built using **OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Streamlit**, the system provides a seamless and intuitive user experience for smart classrooms, presentations, and assistive applications.

The project supports real-time gesture recognition, air-canvas drawing, and AI-powered mathematical problem solving, promoting natural human–computer interaction.

## Features

* **Gesture-Based Drawing:** Draw lines, shapes, and text using intuitive hand gestures.
* **Air Canvas Mode:** Draw in the air and visualize output on a digital canvas in real time.
* **Shape Recognition:** Automatically detects and corrects basic shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles.
* **Line Smoothing:** Enhances visual quality by smoothing hand-drawn strokes.
* **Virtual Math Calculator:** Solve mathematical expressions written using hand gestures.
* **Screenshot Capture:** Save drawings and results directly from the virtual board.
* **Hands-Free Interaction:** No mouse, keyboard, or stylus required.
